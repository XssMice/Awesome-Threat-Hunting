FUNDAMENTALS OF THREAT HUNTING

What is Threat Hunting : Threat Hunting is where people will be searching proactively for cyber threats that are present/hidden in the network. 

Threat Hunters will be closing working with all blue teamers like Soc, Incident Response, Malware analysts, Forensics etc. 

So basically Threat Hunters will be looking for a potential point where our system or network is comprised i.e: Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

In IOC we will be looking for curcials aspects where data and logs and files which can help us to identify the incident that has been already done.

We have 2 Types of IOC's in general 
 
 1. Network Based 
 2. Host Based (System Based)
 
In general we have 3 types of methodologies which is followed by most of the threat hunters.

 1. Intel Based: Here We will be using sources from threat intelligence. So here we will be collecting all the latest indicators, data, ip, logs.
                 In Intel based hunting we can also integrate our process with siem tools and threat intelligence tools. We will be more focusing on more intelligence data.
                 
 2. Hypotheses Based: Here Threat Hunters will looking into analysis of network and host based artifacts and they will be doing risk assessment and vulnerability scanning.
 
 3. Hybrid Based: Here we will be combining both above of the hunting and customize the hunt. This hunting will be dependable on requirement.
 
 
Crown Jewel Analysis: In this Process we will be identifyin the most critical assests of information technology of an organisation.
